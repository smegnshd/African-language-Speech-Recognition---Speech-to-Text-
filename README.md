# African-language-Speech-Recognition---Speech-to-Text-
The World Food Program wants to deploy an intelligent form that collects nutritional information of food bought and sold at markets
in two different countries in Africa - Ethiopia and Kenya. In this work I build a deep learning model that is capable of transcribing
a speech to text and deliver speech-to-text technology for the choosen two  African languages: Amharic and Swahili.
